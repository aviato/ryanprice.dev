                During my tenure at Savage X Fenty, I played a pivotal role in
                the success of a high-traffic Ecommerce web application,
                contributing to the development of Next.js, React, and Redux
                code. In close collaboration with the product team, I crafted
                robust solutions for feature tracking, analytics, A/B Testing,
                localization, and CMS integration. This comprehensive approach
                significantly enhanced the overall user experience.
                Additionally, I consistently delivered critical features and bug
                fixes, ensuring the continuous improvement and seamless
                functionality of the platform.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a seasoned leader, I spearheaded teams of 5 or more
                engineers, providing guidance in the architecture and planning
                of key engineering efforts crucial to business-critical product
                launches. My impact extended beyond Savage X Fenty, as I proudly
                served as a member of the React Oversight and TypeScript
                committees, actively contributing to the evolution of these
                technologies. In tandem, I took on a mentoring role, fostering
                the growth of junior developers through pair programming
                sessions and rigorous code reviews.
