          <p className="mt-4">
            I have been working full time as a software engineer since 2016. I
            love bringing things to life on the page, so I naturally favor front
            end work, but I have worked on full stack projects before as well. I
            have worked remotely since 2019, so I am completely fine working
            from home, but I love to interact with people in person as well!{" "}
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When I'm not at my desk solving problems, you can find me out in
            nature camping and playing music.
